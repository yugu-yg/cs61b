     *   1. chooseBestMove always chooses a legal move that increases the size
     *      of the active region,
     *   2. movesNeeded returns a result corresponding to the number of moves
     *      needed using moves suggested by chooseBestMove.
     *
     * The staff solution uses a considerably more elaborate heuristic that
     * looks several moves ahead and chooses the first of a sequence of moves
     * that will lead to the largest active region.  Simon Tathum's version of
     * flood uses a still more elaborate heuristic than that.
     *
     * Feel free to look for better methods, but we suggest you first make sure
     * you can meet our very minimal requirements.  We have included a depth
     * parameter in the chooser method as a suggested help in doing deeper
     * searches, but have set the search depth to 1 so that you can essentially
     * ignore it, or change it at will.

     * method than that, but also searches several moves ahead.  Perhaps
     * you can do better.  We reflect the fact that we are not requiring
     * you to look multiple moves ahead by setting SEARCH_DEPTH to 1.
